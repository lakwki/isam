		<!--  AUTHENTICATION
          This section sets the authentication policies of the application. Possible modes are "Windows",
          "Forms", "Passport" and "None"

          "None" No authentication is performed.
          "Windows" IIS performs authentication (Basic, Digest, or Integrated Windows) according to
           its settings for the application. Anonymous access must be disabled in IIS.
          "Forms" You provide a custom form (Web page) for users to enter their credentials, and then
           you authenticate them in your application. A user credential token is stored in a cookie.
          "Passport" Authentication is performed via a centralized authentication service provided
           by Microsoft that offers a single logon and core profile services for member sites.
